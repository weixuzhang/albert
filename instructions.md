# Project Plan: AI Agent Sandbox Prototype

## Project Objective

Develop a modular, clearly structured sandbox prototype integrating multiple AI agents—Albert Core, Planning Agent, and Questioning Agent—to facilitate dynamic, interactive user experiences. The prototype will clearly define agent interactions, internal logic, and output formatting.

## Agents Overview

### 1. Albert Core

* **Role**: Main user-facing interface.
* **Responsibilities**:

  * Receive and process initial user inputs.
  * Provide immediate responses or preliminary processing.

### 2. Planning Agent

* **Role**: Strategic plan formulation.
* **Responsibilities**:

  * Analyze Albert Core's output.
  * Create structured plans detailing step-by-step processes.
  * Document tasks clearly in JSON format.

### 3. Questioning Agent (Slot Filler)

* **Role**: Clarification and information augmentation.
* **Responsibilities**:

  * Review and refine plans from the Planning Agent.
  * Identify and fill any missing or ambiguous details required to execute plans.

### 4. Orchestrator

* **Role**: Central coordinator.
* **Responsibilities**:

  * Manage interactions between agents.
  * Consolidate agent outputs into structured JSON for easy conversion to YAML.

## Work Plan

### 1. Initial Setup 
* Define basic classes for each agent.
* Establish JSON structure standard for agent outputs.
* Develop initial orchestrator logic for agent communication.

### 2. Agent Logic Development 
* Albert Core: Develop basic user interaction logic.
* Planning Agent: Create initial simple task planning logic.
* Questioning Agent: Implement basic slot-filling logic.
* Conduct unit tests for individual agent classes.

### 3. Integration and Refinement
* Integrate all agents within the orchestrator framework.
* Perform system-wide testing and debugging.
* Validate JSON outputs adhere to project standards.

### 4. Evaluation and Documentation 
* Conduct user-driven testing scenarios.
* Document each agent’s logic, interactions, and JSON structure.
* Prepare final prototype demonstration.

## Deliverables

* Python-based sandbox prototype with clearly structured agent modules.
* Comprehensive unit tests for each agent and orchestrator.
* Project documentation detailing each agent’s roles, responsibilities, and interaction logic.
* Final JSON output examples ready for YAML conversion.

## Technical Requirements

* Language: Python
* Output Format: JSON (structured for future YAML conversion)
* Development Environment: Python 3.x, standard libraries

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk Description                        | Mitigation Plan                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Unclear agent responsibility boundaries | Document detailed roles before development begins |
| Difficulty integrating agents           | Implement modular, unit-testable code             |
| Ambiguities in JSON to YAML conversion  | Define strict JSON schema early                   |

## Future Extensions (Optional)

* Enhanced NLP capabilities for Albert Core.
* More sophisticated decision-making logic in the Planning Agent.
* Robust information-gathering techniques for the Questioning Agent.
